# ARM episodes

This repository contains the code for the following 3 ARM episodes:
- Reversing ARM applications (Episode 1)
- ARM shellcoding (Episode 2)
- ARM exploitations (Episode 3)

Environment: 
- Raspberry pi 3 (Model B ARM-Cortex-A53)
- Raspbian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)

Initially I split the work into three parts, these are the first publications on the @quequero website<br>
https://quequero.org/2017/07/arm-exploitation-iot-episode-1/<br>
https://quequero.org/2017/09/arm-exploitation-iot-episode-2/<br>
https://quequero.org/2017/11/arm-exploitation-iot-episode-3/<br>

I have decided to combine the three works in a single pdf, for a better reading.
I have only fixed some typing errors.
